This app is called Kennect Four.

It is a connect four app, programmed by Ken Thomas.

I technically coded another working version of a connect four app in ruby as well, but
it was not so test driven and much easier to write.  It can be found at https://gist.github.com/kat3185/10cb06d32383d64f53e7 if you're interested.

Please feel free to reach out to me by e-mail (Ken.Thomas.3185@gmail.com) or slack.  I'm very interested in the developer apprentice role, but I'd also greatly appreciate any coding feedback you may have.
